TEST KITCHEN TIPS
:
Secret to Tender Shortcake
: Make sure the butter is cold and cut it in until it’s about the size of peas. As it melts during baking, this will create the small air pockets that give the biscuit its flakiness.
Golden Brown Goodness
: Brushing the biscuit tops with cream helps the sugar stay in place as well as giving the top a rich golden brown color when it's baked.
Bump up the Biscuit
: Stir grated lemon zest, orange zest or a bit of spice such as ground cardamom into the biscuit mixture. Add a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg to the sugar on top.
Don't Have Buttermilk?
: Place a tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice in a measuring cup and fill with regular milk to reach the 1 cup mark.
Swap the Fruit
: Add fresh herbs or a favorite liqueur into the strawberry mixture, or substitute sliced mangoes, or peaches and blueberries, for the strawberries.
Whip Smart
: It’s important the heavy cream is cold when you mix it—you’ll get more volume. Start out on low speed and be patient. You can make the whipped cream up to 2 hours ahead, then gently stir to reincorporate when you’re ready to serve it.
Perfect Berries
: Avoid mashing the strawberries too long or they will become mushy.

CAST-IRON CAST-IRON CHOCOLATE CHIP BANANA BREAD TIPS
How do you keep bread from sticking to cast iron?
To keep your bread from sticking to the cast-iron skillet, make sure to grease the cast iron pan before adding in the batter. Also, double-check you are using a nicely seasoned cast iron skillet that’s shiny and smooth and doesn’t have a rough texture with rust on it.
Why does my banana bread not cook in the middle?
A few possible reasons your bread is not baked in the middle is because your leavening agents aren’t active anymore, you haven’t used enough flour, or you need to bake the bread longer. If your bread is still wet in the middle after 25-30 minutes, try lightly covering the bread with foil to prevent further browning and bake for 5-10 minutes longer or until a toothpick comes out clean.
Why is my banana bread not moist?
If your banana bread is not moist, chances are the batter could have been overmixed, which can lead to a dry-dense bread. Stir just until ingredients are combined. Also, avoid overbaking. Bake the bread just until the center is cooked, and a toothpick comes out clean or a with a few small dry crumbs. Another reason the bread may be dry is too much flour. Avoid using a heavy amount of flour by reading our guide for how to measure ingredients. Research contributed by Sarah Fischer, Taste of Home Culinary Assistant

STRAWBERRY CAKE TIPS
How do I make a cake more moist?
First, make sure you're following baking best practices! Don't overbake, measure ingredients carefully, and if the recipe calls for butter, make sure you're using the real stuff instead of margarine or a butter substitute. Then, try some of these tricks for upping the moisture:
If you're making a box cake, a small amount of mayo (1/4 to 1/2 cup) added to the batter will make your cake more tender and moist without interfering with the chemistry. And you won't taste the mayo, we promise!
Try mixing flours. If the recipe calls for all-purpose flour, try replacing half of it with cake flour for a more tender crumb. Or, replacing 25% of the all-purpose flour with almond flour or coconut flour—the higher fat content adds moisture.
Brush baked layers with liqueur or a simple syrup. Let the liquid soak in before adding frosting; if you use this trick, it's more vital than ever to use a crumb coat.
Can I put fresh fruit in a cake mix?
Yes, but you do need to be careful to avoid adding too much liquid to the batter. Cut the fruit into small pieces, and pat it dry with a paper towel. Toss the fruit with a little bit of flour before folding it gently into the batter. The flour coating will keep the fruit from leaking into the cake and help prevent the fruit from sinking to the bottom of the pan. You can add pureed fruit to a cake mix; a mix is much more tolerant of that kind of fiddling than a scratch cake.
Can I add fresh fruit to my cake frosting?
Pureed fruit makes a great addition to classic buttercream frosting; just increase the amount of powdered sugar and reduce the amount of milk as needed to keep a spreadable consistency.
What can I do with strawberries that are getting old?
If you're eating berries straight in a bowl, the fresher the better! But if your berries are overripe, they're still great for baking and using in strawberry recipes.

Ingredients
	1/3 cup sugar
	1/3 cup packed brown sugar
	1/4 cup all-purpose flour
	1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
	1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
	1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
	6 to 7 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples
	1 tablespoon lemon juice
	Dough for double-crust pie
	1 tablespoon butter
	1 large egg white
	Optional: Turbinado or coarse sugar, ground cinnamon, vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce

Directions
	Preheat oven to 375°. On a lightly floured surface, roll one half of dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. In a small bowl, combine sugars, flour and spices. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. Add sugar mixture; toss to coat. Add filling; dot with butter. Roll remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edge. Cut slits in top. Beat egg white until foamy; brush over crust. If desired, sprinkle with turbinado sugar and ground cinnamon. Cover edge loosely with foil. Bake 25 minutes. Remove foil; bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 20-25 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack. If desired, serve with ice cream and caramel sauce.
APPLE PIE TIPS
What are the best apples to use in pies?
In the Taste of Home Test Kitchen, we prefer using Granny Smith for pies because of its tart flavor and ability to hold its shape. If you want something with a little more sweetness, we recommend using Braeburn, Golden Delicious or Jonagold. Learn more about the best apples for apple pie to determine which is the best one for you!
How many apples are in 6 cups?
Typically, 1 medium apple yields 1-1/3 cups sliced. For 6 cups of sliced apples, you will need about 5 medium apples.
How do you keep the bottom of a pie from getting soggy?
To avoid a pie bottom from getting soggy, allow the bottom crust to heat more rapidly than the rest of the pie. To do this, place a baking sheet in the oven while preheating and then bake your pie on the pan.
Is it better to bake a pie in glass or metal?
Both metal and glass pie plates work well for baking double-crust pies. But for single-crust pies that are pre-baked, a metal plate is preferred because it heats quicker and ensures a crisp crust.
How do I keep my pie filling from being watery?
To prevent your pie from getting watery, make sure to have your pie crust ready before mixing the filling. The longer the filling sits before baking, the more moisture it will release. Follow these best-kept pie crust secrets so your crust can hold your pie filling nice and strong!
Dough for double-crust pie
Combine 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour and 1/2 tsp. salt; cut in 1 cup cold butter until crumbly. Gradually add 1/3 to 2/3 cup ice water, tossing with a fork until dough holds together when pressed. Divide dough in half. Shape each into a disk; wrap and refrigerate 1 hour.

Ingredients
	1 cup butter, softened
	1/2 cup sugar
	1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
	2 cups all-purpose flour
	1/2 cup cornstarch
	1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions
	In large bowl, cream butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Combine flour, cornstarch and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. Roll dough into a 15x2x1-in. rectangle; chill. Preheat oven to 325°. Cut into 1/4-in. slices; place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Prick with a fork. Bake 10-12 minutes or until set. Remove to wire racks to cool.
SHORTBREAD TIPS
Why do you put cornstarch in shortbread?
Some shortbread recipes, like this one, use cornstarch to create a light, tender texture. Cornstarch contains no gluten, so it helps prevent the toughening that can happen when a wheat flour dough gets overworked. Check out more secrets to spectacular shortbread.
Why do you poke holes in shortbread?
Poking small holes in your dough allows some steam to escape while baking, preventing bubbles inside your cookies. This results in a more uniform texture throughout your shortbread.
Can I use granulated sugar instead of confectioners' sugar?
You can use granulated sugar in this easy shortbread recipe, but you'll need to decrease the amount by about a fourth. The reason is granulated sugar is more dense than powdered, so you get more sweetness per cup by volume. You can also make your own confectioners' sugar by pulsing granulated sugar in a food processor or blender until it's fine and fluffy.
How long do shortbread cookies last?
Avoid common cookie storage mistakes and your shortbread will last longer. At room temperature in an airtight container–like one of these cookie storage containers—your shortbread cookies will last up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to three months.

ICED ORANGE COOKIE TIPS
Can I use a different type of citrus in these cookies?
Of course! Proceed with substituting your preferred citrus (lemon, lime, etc.) in place of orange and proceed as the recipe instructs. However, keep in mind that using baking substitutions may change the flavor and texture of your cookies.
Can I freeze these orange cookies?
Yes—here's how to freeze cookies. For this recipe, we recommend freezing the raw cookie dough ahead of time, and then later thawing it before baking and icing the cookies. You can also bake the cookies before freezing them, but don't freeze them with the icing on. Instead, prepare the glaze while the cookies thaw and then ice the cookies as the recipe instructs.
What are drop cookies?
The term ‘drop cookies’ refers to the method by which you place the cookie dough onto the cookie sheet. In this case, you ‘drop' the dough by the spoonful. Drop cookies tend to have a soft texture—here are some of our favorite drop cookie recipes.

RED VELVET CAKE TIPS
What can you use instead of buttermilk in this red velvet cake recipe?
A craving for red velvet cake doesn’t always coincide with having buttermilk in your refrigerator. Luckily, there are a number of substitutes you can use in place of buttermilk. Our go-to is milk and lemon juice or vinegar. For each cup of buttermilk needed, use 1 tablespoon of distilled white vinegar or lemon juice, plus enough milk to measure 1 cup. Stir, and let stand for 5 minutes before you add to the mixture. Check out these other buttermilk substitutes to make it work in a pinch!
Do you need to sift the dry ingredients when making this red velvet cake recipe?
Plenty of cake recipes ask you to sift the flour (like many of these five-star cake recipes!). There are good reasons for it: Sifting before you measure the flour aerates it, so you won’t scoop too much. Sifting after you measure lightens the flour, making it easier to mix with the other ingredients (and sometimes you’ll sift flour with the other ingredients to thoroughly combine them). But here’s the good news: You can skip the sift and use a whisk instead. Whisk the flour right in your canister if the recipe calls for sifting before measuring. Otherwise, just pour all the dry ingredients into a bowl and give them a good whisking. This will both aerate the flour and evenly distribute the ingredients.
How can you make cupcakes from this red velvet cake recipe?
To adjust this recipe for cupcakes, keep the baking temperature the same, but reduce your time closer to 15 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
How do you store red velvet cake?
The best way to store this cake is under a cake dome or in a cake keeper. After you’ve sliced a frosted cake, press plastic wrap onto the exposed sponge, which will keep it from drying out. Be sure to eat your cake within three to four days, or freeze your cake (frosted or unfrosted) for up to three months. Learn more about how to properly store cakes!

7UP POUND CAKE TIPS
What does 7UP do for a cake?
7UP is used in place of traditional leaveners such as baking soda or baking powder. The carbonation helps the cake rise and gives it a lift. If you have any leftover 7UP, use it up in one of these other recipes that use lemon-lime soda.
Can I substitute Sprite (or any other soda) for 7UP?
Because 7UP has a higher level of carbonation than Sprite, we suggest you always use 7UP in this pound cake recipe. It will give you the best and most desired results.
How do you keep this cake moist?
The beauty of this 7UP cake is its moist and flavorful texture. To keep it extra moist, a simple syrup is key. You can make simple syrup by boiling equal parts water and sugar until the sugar dissolves. Then, brush the syrup onto the warm cake with a pastry brush after removing the cake from the pan. The warm cake will absorb the syrup, keeping it moist.

Ingredients
	2 cups all-purpose flour
	3 teaspoons baking powder
	1 teaspoon salt
	1/3 cup shortening

CINNAMON COFFEE CAKE TIPS
Why is my cinnamon coffee cake dry?
If your cinnamon coffee cake is dry, it may have been overbaked. Always bake to the minimum cooking time and check for doneness. It’s also important to measure the flour correctly. Before measuring, stir the flour with a spoon or whisk. Spoon the flour into a dry measuring cup until heaping; level with the flat side of a knife. For the most accurate measurement, we suggest weighing the flour.
Why does my cinnamon coffee cake fall apart when I cut it?
Batter that is improperly mixed or undermixed can cause the coffee cake to be crumbly. Careful mixing will evenly distribute the ingredients throughout the batter. Frequently scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl with a plastic spatula will ensure that all ingredients are combined. But be careful not to overmix, which can cause the cake to be tough.
