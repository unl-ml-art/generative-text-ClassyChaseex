# Project 1 Generative Text

Karston Chase, kchase4@huskers.unl.edu

## Abstract

I was thinking of taking on recipe and film approache to generative texts. The AI would generate its own recipe of something for me to bake and I would record a video of me following the instructions no matter what it asks. In the end, I'm hoping I can wind up making something that is actually edible and maybe even learn some type of new experimental cooking technique.

## Model/Data

I trained GPT-2 with a list of around 100 various baking recipies that all included a list of ingredients, specific directions to follow, and even some cooking tips to recommend to you as you follow along.

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code
