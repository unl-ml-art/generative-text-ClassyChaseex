## Abstract

I was thinking of taking on almost a combination of the bucket list and film approaches to generative texts. The AI would generate a list of things for me to do and I would record a video of me doing those things to go along with it. I was also thinking about possibly making it create it's own screen directions for me. This way I would have specific actions I would have to perform while doing certain tasks and maybe it'll pick settings for them as well. In the end, I want to make a short video about me crossing things off of an AI generated bucket list in interesting and entertaining ways.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). what is your corpus?

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
  - [This is a paper](this_is_the_link.pdf)
- Repositories
- Blog posts
